/** \page rexdfa rexdfa_t - Using the DFA for matching.

- 1. Create @ref rexdfa_t object using @ref rex_db_todfa. At this point you can destroy the rexdb_t objects.
- 2. Use @ref rexdfa_t to implement matching/searching.
- 3. Destroy the rexdfa_t object when you are done with it.


Note: You could also create a @ref rex_nfasimulator_t and/or @ref rex_dfasimulator_t object to run the NFA/DFA automaton directly
from rexdb_t object, but the recommended way is to create rexdfa_t object.
