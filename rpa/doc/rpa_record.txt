/** \page rpa_record rparecord_t - Parse results.
The rpa_stat_parse populates an array(@ref rarray_t) with @ref rparecord_t 
structures. The parser generates starting and ending record of 
type @ref RPA_RECORD_START and @ref RPA_RECORD_END for every matching rule. 
If a rule A contains other rules B, C, D the records generated 
for B, C, D will appear between the starting and ending records of A. If B, C or D 
contain other rules, their records will be placed between the starting and ending 
records of B, C or D. If a rule doesn't contain any other rules, it will 
generate a start record immediately followed by an end record. The whole 
array of records forms an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
