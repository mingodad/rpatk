/** \page rpa_bnf BNF Syntax.

@section intro Introduction
A BNF specification or schema is a set of derivation rules, written as:

@code
rulename ::= __expression__
@endcode

where rulename is a nonterminal, and the __expression__ consists of one or more sequences of rulenames or terminals.
This is an example BNF specification of a postal address:

@code
name_part      ::= <personal_part> <last_name> <opt_jr_part> | <personal_part> <name_part>
personal_part  ::= <first_name> | <initial> "." 
street_address ::= <house_num> <street_name> <apt_num>?
zip_part       ::= <town_name> "," <state_code> <ZIP_code>
opt_jr_part    ::= "Sr." | "Jr." | <roman_numeral> | ""
postal_address ::= <name_part> <street_address> <zip_part>
@endcode

This example is not complete, because there still some nonterminals that are not specified. It should just give you an idea
how to create a sequence of rulenames to build a full BNF specification.
